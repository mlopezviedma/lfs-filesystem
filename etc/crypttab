# /etc/crypttab: mappings for encrypted partitions
#
# Each mapped device will be created in /dev/mapper, so your /etc/fstab
# should use the /dev/mapper/<name> paths for encrypted devices.
#
# NOTE: Do not list your root (/) partition here, it must be set up
# beforehand by the initramfs (/etc/mkinitcpioconf).
